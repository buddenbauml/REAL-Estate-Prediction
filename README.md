REAL Estate Prediction Project
The AnalysisScript.py file contains data visualization and regression prediction model functions that are loaded into the PythonProjectDashboard.py file.
The Dashboard file when run in VSCode initiates a Flask instances run locally on your device.
The data comes from a very large real estate data set on kaggle linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset
I could not upload the excel file of the dataset here as it exceeds the Github file size limit.
